            <p> Disclaimer because I'm not really going to be considering Minx as Dreamcatcher since Minx was before they redebuted as Dreamcatcher and did not have Handong or Gayeon as part of their lineup. </p>
            <p>I decided to write about Dreamcatcher partially because I was curious about how much information I actually retained about them. It turns out that I knew more than I thought, but I still needed to search quite a few things up. At any rate, I hope that your browsing through this help you to either familiarize yourself with or opens your eyes to a new group of singers that release absolute bangers every few months that are accompanied by brilliant showcases.</p>
