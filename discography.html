        <h2> Discography </h2>
        <p> Dreamcatcher has released a total of 2 full studio albums, 2 single albums, 7 extended plays (EPs), and 15 singles. I will focus mostly on their albums and extended plays rather than their singles in this segment. Their first full studio album was released in 2019 under Pony Canyon in Japan called <i>The Beginning of the End</i>. Their second full album was released on February 18, 2020 and was called <i>Dystopia: The Tree of Language</i>. Their first EP was released in 2017 and peaked at 4th on music charts in Korea. They then released two EPs in 2018: <i>Escape the Era</i> and <i>Alone in the City</i> which peaked at 3 and 2 respectively. Then, in 2019 they released <i>The End of Nightmare</i> which peaked at 3rd. Later the same year, Raid of Dream was released as a collaboration between Dreamcatcher and the mobile game King's Raid (btw Handon's "I'm holding this pain" is so iconic and arguably the best line in the entire song, like T-T...). In 2020, they released <i>Dystopia:Lose Myself</i> with the title track Boca. Finally, in 2021, they released <i>Dystopia: Road to Utopia</i> with the title track Odd Eye. Sadly, it does not seem like Dreamcatcher will be able to win on any music shows, but they did chard #1 on music charts with the release. <br>
