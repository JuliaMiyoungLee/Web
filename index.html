        <p> Disclaimer because I'm not really going to be considering Minx as Dreamcatcher since Minx was before they redebuted as Dreamcatcher and did not have Handong or Gayeon as part of their lineup. </p>
        <h2> <a id="Click_Here_To_See_Members"> Members </a> </h2>
        <p> The 7 members of Dreamcatcher include Yoohyeon, SuA, Dami, JiU, Siyeon, Handong, and Gahyeon. Each of the members have their own unique official positions within the group. Starting off, we have JiU who is the leader of Dreamcatcher. She is also lead dancer and lead vocal. In the image at the top of this page, she is the third from the right. Next is SuA, the main dancer, lead vocalist, and sub rapper of the group who can be found in the center of the image. Siyeon's only position in Dreamcatcher is main vocalist, but she takes complete control of that area and she is the first person from the left in the image above. Handong is a sub vocalist and the only foreign member as she was born in China. She is the third person from the left in the image above. Next is Yoohyeon who is a lead vocalist and lead dancer of Dreamcatcher. She is the girl second from the right. Dami is the main rapper of Dreamcatcher and also holds the positions of lead dancer and sub vocalist. She is the first one from the left in the image. Last, but certainly not least, we have Gahyeon, the maknae (youngest) of Dreamcatcher. She is the lead rapper and also takes the position of sub vocal, and she can be found second from the left. Although each member does hold a specific position, they are not confined by them and often take parts that do not necessarily come with their position responsibilities. <br>

        <h2> <a id="Click_For_Discography"> Discography </a> </h2>
        <p> Dreamcatcher has released a total of 2 full studio albums, 2 single albums, 7 extended plays (EPs), and 15 singles. I will focus mostly on their albums and extended plays rather than their singles in this segment. Their first full studio album was released in 2019 under Pony Canyon in Japan called <i>The Beginning of the End</i>. Their second full album was released on February 18, 2020 and was called <i>Dystopia: The Tree of Language</i>. Their first EP was released in 2017 and peaked at 4th on music charts in Korea. They then released two EPs in 2018: <i>Escape the Era</i> and <i>Alone in the City</i> which peaked at 3 and 2 respectively. Then, in 2019 they released <i>The End of Nightmare</i> which peaked at 3rd. Later the same year, Raid of Dream was released as a collaboration between Dreamcatcher and the mobile game King's Raid (btw Handon's "I'm holding this pain" is so iconic and arguably the best line in the entire song, like T-T...). In 2020, they released <i>Dystopia:Lose Myself</i> with the title track Boca. Finally, in 2021, they released <i>Dystopia: Road to Utopia</i> with the title track Odd Eye. Sadly, it does not seem like Dreamcatcher will be able to win on any music shows, but they did chard #1 on music charts with the release. <br>

        <p> Below I will talk about Dreamcatcher's music videos as well as provide links to each one on youtube. While I will not be covering every single one of the their releases on youtube (for what I think are pretty obvious reasons), I will be talking about some of their more significant releases as well as some correlations between the concepts of a few of their themes (may or may not be a very opinionated section, not that I think it really matters). Their debut song was "Chase Me" and the song released the year after that was "Good Night". Both were very similar in terms of sound, both encorporating the use of rock and metal, and also resembled each other as both videos focused on their nightmare concept. With dark somewhat gothic themes being prominent in their outfits and the setting, Dreamcatcher introduced themselves as a very unique group. In 2017, with the release of <i>Prequel</i>, the music video for "Fly High" was also released. This video still had a nightmare-esque vibe to it, but seemed to lean more heavily to fantasy and was a lot brighter than their previous two music videos. The music itself also took a lot of J-Rock inspiration just like "Chase Me" and "Good Night" (It could literally be an anime opening. It's so good). Then, their music video for "You and I" was released which seemed to combine some of the fantasy aspects of "Fly High" with the nightmare concept from "Chase Me". There's so much more to talk about, but you should just watch the videos... Not that anyone reading this actually is interested in Dreamcatcher, but since I have to add some links... I will. <br>

        <h2> <a id="Opinions"> The Author's Opinions </a> </h2>
        <p> Okay, so this is basically where I just spew some justification regarding why I really really like Dreamcatcher. I think it's also worth noting that I'm not actually <i>that</i> big of a Dreamcatcher fan. I do really enjoy their music (which might make me a fan of LEEZ and Ollounder not DC, but I digress), but I wouldn't say that I like them much more than other artists like Hoppipolla or AKMU. I just thought of them first when I saw the prompt because they had a comeback recently! Btw check Hoppipolla out because nobody I know knows who they are. Also, I don't mean the song Hoppipolla, but the band. So, I think that one really important thing to note about Dreamcatcher is the fact that their concept is something that I rarely see in the K-Pop industry. Like, the nightmare concept was just something that not that many groups were too fond of and the fact that Dreamcatcher just went and added rock music to that made their comebacks unique and beautiful. I also want to note that LEEZ and Ollounder are the main producers for the majority of Dreamcatcher's songs, and I think that they're musical geniuses. Their most recent comeback with the title track "Odd Eye" actually seems to be less rock oriented and is shifting more to the typical "K-Pop style". By this, I mean to say that it's a lot more synth based and does not feature as much electric guitar as their previous releases did. Their comeback right before this one was with "Boca" which also shared a cyberpunk vibe. I'd say that starting from "Scream", their songs have become less rock based. Honestly, I'm not sure exactly how I feel about this because Dreamcatcher's constant supply of rock music was really something that I enjoyed, but their new songs still sound amazing, so it's not really like they're disappointing me that much. I'd like it if their next comeback featured some heavy metal, though. I also would like to note that Dreamcatcher's choreography has always been pretty intense and their outfits are overall pretty cool too. I'm not a big expert on wardrobe choices or dancing as I'm more interested in their music, so those are just some casual opinions. At any rate, I'd 10/10 recommend checking out any of their albums unless you don't like "noisy" music. They have some more laid back releases, but if you listen to a random track from Dreamcatcher, it's more or less likely to be some pretty loud stuff, so if you're not into that, I guess this'll be a pass. <br>
        If you want more information on Dreamcatcher's history and stuff like that, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dreamcatcher_(group)" target="_blank"> this</a> is a link to their Wiki page which will probably suffice when it comes to giving you any firm data on them. Hopefully you enjoy~ </p>
