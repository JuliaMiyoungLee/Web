        <p> Okay, so this is basically where I just spew some justification regarding why I really really like Dreamcatcher. I think it's also worth noting that I'm not actually <i>that</i> big of a Dreamcatcher fan. I do really enjoy their music (which might make me a fan of LEEZ and Ollounder not DC, but I digress), but I wouldn't say that I like them much more than other artists like Hoppipolla or AKMU. I just thought of them first when I saw the prompt because they had a comeback recently! Btw check Hoppipolla out because nobody I know knows who they are. Also, I don't mean the song Hoppipolla, but the band. So, I think that one really important thing to note about Dreamcatcher is the fact that their concept is something that I rarely see in the K-Pop industry. Like, the nightmare concept was just something that not that many groups were too fond of and the fact that Dreamcatcher just went and added rock music to that made their comebacks unique and beautiful. I also want to note that LEEZ and Ollounder are the main producers for the majority of Dreamcatcher's songs, and I think that they're musical geniuses. Their most recent comeback with the title track "Odd Eye" actually seems to be less rock oriented and is shifting more to the typical "K-Pop style". By this, I mean to say that it's a lot more synth based and does not feature as much electric guitar as their previous releases did. Their comeback right before this one was with "Boca" which also shared a cyberpunk vibe. I'd say that starting from "Scream", their songs have become less rock based. Honestly, I'm not sure exactly how I feel about this because Dreamcatcher's constant supply of rock music was really something that I enjoyed, but their new songs still sound amazing, so it's not really like they're disappointing me that much. I'd like it if their next comeback featured some heavy metal, though. I also would like to note that Dreamcatcher's choreography has always been pretty intense and their outfits are overall pretty cool too. I'm not a big expert on wardrobe choices or dancing as I'm more interested in their music, so those are just some casual opinions. At any rate, I'd 10/10 recommend checking out any of their albums unless you don't like "noisy" or "loud" music considering the fact that a large majority of their songs are rock songs. They have some more laid back releases, but if you listen to a random track from Dreamcatcher, it's more or less likely to be some pretty loud stuff, so if you're not into that, I guess this'll be a pass. <br>
        If you want more information on Dreamcatcher's history and stuff like that, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dreamcatcher_(group)" target="_blank"> this</a> is a link to their Wiki page which will probably suffice when it comes to giving you any firm data on them. Hopefully you enjoy~ </p>
