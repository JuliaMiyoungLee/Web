        <h2> Videography </h2>
        <p> Below I will talk about Dreamcatcher's music videos as well as provide links to each one on youtube. While I will not be covering every single one of the their releases on youtube (for what I think are pretty obvious reasons), I will be talking about some of their more significant releases as well as some correlations between the concepts of a few of their themes (may or may not be a very opinionated section, not that I think it really matters). Their debut song was "Chase Me" and the song released the year after that was "Good Night". Both were very similar in terms of sound, both encorporating the use of rock and metal, and also resembled each other as both videos focused on their nightmare concept. With dark somewhat gothic themes being prominent in their outfits and the setting, Dreamcatcher introduced themselves as a very unique group. In 2017, with the release of <i>Prequel</i>, the music video for "Fly High" was also released. This video still had a nightmare-esque vibe to it, but seemed to lean more heavily to fantasy and was a lot brighter than their previous two music videos. The music itself also took a lot of J-Rock inspiration just like "Chase Me" and "Good Night" (It could literally be an anime opening. It's so good). Then, their music video for "You and I" was released which seemed to combine some of the fantasy aspects of "Fly High" with the nightmare concept from "Chase Me". There's so much more to talk about, but you should just watch the videos... Not that anyone reading this actually is interested in Dreamcatcher, but since I have to add some links... I will. <br>
        <a href="https://youtu.be/1QD0FeZyDtQ" target="_blank"> This is a playlist</a> on youtube containing all of their official clips or music videos. It's pretty dope. :> </p>
        
        <h2> Some of My Favorite Video Releases </h2>
        <p> Unlike the discography list of favorite songs, this list is largely based off of the video itself rather than the music. Of course, the music is still good :bloosh:.</p>
