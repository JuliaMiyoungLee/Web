        <h2> Members </h2>
        <p> The 7 members of Dreamcatcher include Yoohyeon, SuA, Dami, JiU, Siyeon, Handong, and Gahyeon. Each of the members have their own unique official positions within the group. Starting off, we have JiU who is the leader of Dreamcatcher. She is also lead dancer and lead vocal. She also holds the position of visual, although, quite honestly, all the members in Dreamcatcher take this role... In the image at the top of this page, she is the third from the right. Next is SuA, the main dancer, sub vocalist, and lead rapper of the group who can be found in the center of the image. Despite her sub vocal roal, she has been given many lines in comparison to many of the other members. Siyeon's only position in Dreamcatcher is main vocalist, but she takes complete control of that area and she is the first person from the left in the image above. Handong is a sub vocalist and the only foreign member as she was born in China. She is the third person from the left in the image above. Next is Yoohyeon who is a lead vocalist of Dreamcatcher. She is the girl second from the right. It could also be noted that she is one of the most active members on fan sites and social media with her very bright attitude. Dami is the main rapper of Dreamcatcher and also holds the positions of lead dancer and sub vocalist. She is the first one from the left in the image. Last, but certainly not least, we have Gahyeon, the maknae (youngest) of Dreamcatcher. She is the lead rapper and also takes the position of sub vocal, and she can be found second from the left. Although each member does hold a specific position, they are not confined by them and often take parts that do not necessarily come with their position responsibilities. <br>
